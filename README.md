./scripts/check.sh
```

This will:
1. Run the linter
2. Execute tests with race detection
3. Generate and display coverage report
4. Build for current platform
5. Test build for all supported platforms

A pre-commit hook is also available that runs these checks automatically before each commit.

### Continuous Integration

The following checks run automatically on pull requests:
- Code linting with golangci-lint
- Unit tests with race detection
- Code coverage reporting
- Multi-platform build verification

### Release Process

1. Update version number where needed
2. Create and push a new tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.x.x
   git push origin v1.x.x
   ```
